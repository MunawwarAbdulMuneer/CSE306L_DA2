This is a Python implementation of a virtual hospital agent that monitors and diagnoses patients remotely. It uses basic natural language processing (NLP) using Gensim to extract symptoms from the patient's description of the ailment and a multi-class Naive Bayes classification model trained on the 'Disease Symptom Prediction' dataset to predict the disease, severity and actions to be taken.
